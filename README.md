A study guide for course pre-work
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I’ve learned the very basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and Git. Still have a long way to go but my motivation is to incorporate what I learn in this bootcamp with my existing product design skills to become a more experienced creative. I have built this project to test and experiment with the features I will be learning throughout the course. It solves the problem of having notes everywhere and I learnt the basics of what’s to come in this 16-week coding adventure.
